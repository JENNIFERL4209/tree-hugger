                        will earn coins to plant a real tree on Earth. This is a great way to improve our environment on Earth and of course, FOCUS! </p>

                    <li>Ecosia is a search engine, so it gains money from search ads. It takes 80% of that profit and gives it away to tree supporting programs.</li>

                    <li>For Ecosia, this varies and is all based on the data they collect. They do research on where in the world planting trees would be the most beneficial and funding the tree supporting program’s needs to plant trees.</li>
                    <li>Forest, doesn’t decide where the trees are planted, instead they leave that decision to their partner organization <i>Trees for The Future</i>, who mainly focus on planting trees in Africa. </li><br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Allowing trees to make crop’s soil more fertile and protect crops by lowering the the effect wind has on crops.</li>
                            </ul>
